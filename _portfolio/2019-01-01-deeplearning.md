EMBO Installation Grant project (2019-2023) focused on applying deep learning approaches to identify patterns in genomic and transcriptomic data. The research aimed to develop novel computational methods for understanding complex biological patterns and regulatory mechanisms.

Research focus areas:
- Development of deep learning architectures for sequence analysis
- Identification of regulatory elements in genomic sequences
- Characterization of transcriptomic patterns
- Integration of multi-omics data through machine learning
