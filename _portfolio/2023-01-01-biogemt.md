As the ERA Chair, leading the Bioinformatics for Genomics in Malta (BioGeMT) project from 2023 to 2027. This project aims to establish state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities for genomics research at the University of Malta. The initiative includes building research infrastructure, developing novel computational approaches, and training the next generation of bioinformaticians in Malta.

Project objectives:
- Establish a bioinformatics research group focusing on genomics and transcriptomics
- Develop innovative computational methods for analyzing -omics data
- Build local capacity through training and education
- Foster international collaborations in bioinformatics research
