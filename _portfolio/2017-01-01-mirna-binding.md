Czech Granting Agency (GACR) Junior project (2017-2022) focused on developing computational approaches for microRNA binding site classification that go beyond the traditional seed-based methods. The research aimed to identify and characterize non-canonical miRNA binding sites and improve target prediction accuracy.

Research components:
- Development of seed-agnostic classification algorithms
- Integration of RNA secondary structure in binding site prediction
- Characterization of non-canonical miRNA binding mechanisms
- Creation of tools for improved miRNA target prediction
