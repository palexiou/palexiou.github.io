Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Widening Fellowship project (2018-2022) focused on applying deep learning approaches to understand the binding characteristics of RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs). The research aimed to develop predictive models for RBP binding sites and elucidate the principles governing RNA-protein interactions.

Research achievements:
- Development of deep learning models for RBP binding prediction
- Characterization of sequence and structural features important for RBP binding
- Creation of tools for analyzing RBP binding patterns
- Integration of multi-omics data to improve binding site prediction
