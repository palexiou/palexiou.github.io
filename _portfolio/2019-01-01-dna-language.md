Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship project (2019-2023) aimed at developing computational approaches to decipher the "language" of DNA and identify regulatory elements. The research focused on classifying transcripts into functional classes and understanding the genomic code that regulates gene expression.

Key research components:
- Development of computational models to predict regulatory elements
- Classification of transcripts based on sequence features
- Integration of evolutionary conservation in regulatory element prediction
- Experimental validation of predicted regulatory regions
