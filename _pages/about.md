Dr. Panagiotis Alexiou is an ERA Chair at the University of Malta, leading the Bioinformatics for Genomics program. Previously, he headed the Bioinformatics Core Facility at CEITEC and conducted research at the University of Pennsylvania. With expertise in genomics, machine learning, and computational biology, Dr. Alexiou holds a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Aristotle University, an M.Sc. from the University of Amsterdam, and a B.Sc. from the University of Aberdeen. His work focuses on developing advanced computational solutions for analyzing complex biological data.

Research Focus
======
My research focuses on computational biology with an emphasis on:

* Genomics and transcriptomics data analysis
* Development of machine learning and deep learning methods for biological data
* RNA biology, particularly small non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins
* Next-generation sequencing data analysis and interpretation
* Computational tools for bioinformatics research

At the University of Malta, I lead the Bioinformatics for Genomics in Malta (BioGeMT) program, where we are building bioinformatics capabilities for -omics analyses. Our team develops novel computational approaches to address complex biological questions and enhance our understanding of molecular processes.

Recent Projects
======
* **Deep learning approaches for transcriptome analysis**: Developing neural network-based methods to analyze RNA sequences and expression patterns
* **miRBench**: A comprehensive microRNA binding site prediction training and benchmarking dataset
* **RBP-Tar**: A searchable database for experimental RNA-binding protein binding sites
* **ENNGene**: An easy neural network model building tool for genomics
* **PENGUINN**: Precise exploration of nuclear G-quadruplexes using interpretable neural networks
